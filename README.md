# AMA3020-Pairs-Project
Hydrogen Molecular Ion Pairs Project

These are the supplementary materials to the report on the solution to the Schroedinger Equation of the hydrogen molecular ion. 

Ref (i) refers to the ith Reference in the report.

pairs_project_supp_1.pdf contains the supplementary steps for the Methodology section in the report (up to Equation (6)) - the variable separation of the single electron wavefunction from the time-independent Schroedinger equation using new co-ordinates for the Hydrogen molecular ion, and the solution to the azimuthal ordinary differential equation. The azimuthal solution is shown for the monatomic Hydrogen for simplicity. "Natural Units" are also introduced to simplify, the solutions would therefore be in these units. 

Invesitagtions_supp2.pdf contains the supplementary steps for the Results section in the report - a brief explanation of the wavefunction of the electron in the unperturbed hydrogen atom (from Pauling), and a more in-depth explanation/ derivation of the finite difference methods.
