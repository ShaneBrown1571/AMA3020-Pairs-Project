# AMA3020-Pairs-Project
Hydrogen Molecular Ion Pairs Project

These are the supplementary materials to the report on the solution to the Schroedinger Equation of the hydrogen molecular ion. 

pairs_project_supp_1.pdf contains the supplementary steps for the Methodology section in the report - the variable separation of the single electron wavefunction from the time-independent Schroedinger equation using new co-ordinates, and the solution to the azimuthal ordinary differential equation.

Invesitagtions_supp2.pdf contains the supplementary steps for the Results section in the report - a brief explanation of the wavefunction of the electron in the unperturbed hydrogen atom (from Pauling), and a more in-depth explanation/ derivation of the finite difference methods.
